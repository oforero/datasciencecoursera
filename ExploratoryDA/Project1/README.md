## Homework

This is my solution to the Exploratory Data Analysis [project 1](Instructions.md).

## How to run the code 

To facilitate running the code the working directory needs to be set to the folder containing the scripts:

* setwd("/Users/Oscar/Classes/JohnsHopkins/datasciencecoursera/ExploratoryDA/Project1")

After that every Plot Script can be run independently, it will look for a data frame binded to the name "power".
If the binding does not exist it will load the data and filter the required dates only.

After that it will write a PNG file of the same name as the script in a subdirectory named "figure"

## Results 

### Plot 1


![Gobal Active Power (Histogram)](figure/plot1.png) 


### Plot 2

![Global Active Power (Lines)](figure/plot2.png) 


### Plot 3

![Energy sub metering (Lines)](figure/plot3.png) 


### Plot 4

![Multiple plots in one](figure/plot4.png)
